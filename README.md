Fashion MNIST Classification
Overview
This project aims to classify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset using various machine learning algorithms. Fashion MNIST is a dataset comprising 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items belonging to 10 different categories. The objective of this project is to develop models capable of accurately classifying these items into their respective categories.

Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset is a variant of the original MNIST dataset and contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image representing various fashion items such as t-shirts, trousers, dresses, shoes, and more. The dataset is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in the context of image classification tasks.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: The initial step involves preprocessing the data, which may include resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms will be explored for classification, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Model Training: The selected models are trained on the training dataset using appropriate training algorithms and techniques. Hyperparameter tuning may also be performed to optimize model performance.

Model Evaluation: Once trained, the models are evaluated on the testing dataset to assess their accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to ensure robustness of the results.

Deployment (Optional): Depending on project requirements, the trained model may be deployed for inference on new unseen data. This could involve creating a web application, API, or integrating the model into existing systems.
